    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 4-8Lb Lamb shoulder</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Olive oil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Salt</li>
        <li>Tbsp Dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Dried crushed sage</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dried basil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dried crushed bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sugar</li>     
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
       <li>Trim about 2-inches of the bottom tough ends from the asparagus spears and set aside. 
           Cut remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces. Spread out asparagus pieces and garbanzo beans on the prepared baking sheet. 
           Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt, pepper and garlic powder; toss well to coat.
       </li>
       <li>Roast in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and beans are slightly toasted, about 20 minutes.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add reserved asparagus ends and cook until very tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and place into a food processor or blender.</li>
       <li>Return water to boiling, add pasta, and cook,  stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 12 minutes (depending on pasta variety.) Drain pasta well and return to the pot.</li>
       <li>While pasta is cooking, combine Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original Almondmilk, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon of each salt, pepper, and garlic powder, lemon zest ,and lemon juice in blender or food processor with the boiled asparagus. 
           Blend until sauce is smooth.</li>
       <li>Toss sauce with hot cooked pasta and stir in roasted asparagus and garbanzo beans. Top with shaved Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
