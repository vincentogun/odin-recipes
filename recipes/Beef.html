    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons harissa (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 pound pappardelle pasta, cooked and drained</li>
        <li>grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>  
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Sear meat until browned on every side, working in batches if necessary, about 10 minutes. Remove from Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors meld, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting board and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
