    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of delicious ways to marinate fish for grilling, but we're partial to this sweet and savory salmon marinade: Salmon filets are seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, then marinated in a delicious combination of the following ingredients: soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. 
        Make sure to let the filets marinate in the fridge for at least two hours to reach their full flavor potential.
